There are `r n_repos` repositories in the Strategy Unit Organisation.\

Of these, `r n_with_codeowners_public` **public** repositories and `r n_with_codeowners_private` **private** repositories have a CODEOWNERS file.\
\
The following table is a count of users mentioned in the CODEOWNERS files of public repositories in the Strategy Unit Organisation.\
\

```{r}
#| echo: false
gt::gt(codeowners_overview |> 
         dplyr::arrange(
           stringr::str_to_lower(owner)
           )
)
```
